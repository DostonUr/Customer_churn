# Customer_churn
n this project, I performed an end-to-end analysis on a telecom dataset to predict customer churn using supervised machine learning models(through Mohierdev praktikum). 🔍 Key Steps:

Data Cleaning and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Feature Engineering and Transformation

Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Evaluation with Accuracy, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

Model Comparison and Insights

📈 Tools & Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

🚀 Goal: Improve churn prediction accuracy to support customer retention strategies.
